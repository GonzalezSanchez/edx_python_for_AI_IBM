Write test cases for these scenarios.
    -   When 2 and 4 are given as input the output must be 6.
    -   When 0 and 0 are given as input the output must be 0.
    -   When 2.3 and 3.6 are given as input the output must be 5.9.
    -   When the strings ‘hello’ and ‘world’ are given as input the output must be ‘helloworld’.
    -   When 2.3000 and 4.300 are given as input the output must be 6.6.
    -   When -2 and -2 are given as input the output must not be 0. (Hint : Use assertNotEqual)

#unittest.main()
#using this option (unittest.main), according to ChatGPT:
#'This will immediately run the tests when the Python file is imported or executed,
# there is no control over when it runs.
#The problem is that If you import this file into another module (e.g., for reuse),
# the tests will run automatically, which is usually undesirable.


#according to GPT it should be (good practtce) and not (unitest.main):
if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
# when we import test, then __name__ is set to "test", so the block is skipped
